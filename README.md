# Loan-Default-Prediction
Analyze small business loan guarantees using predictive analytics on "SBAnational.csv". Goal: predict "CHGOFF" status, minimizing risks as guarantor. Proactive management supports small businesses.


1. Data Selection:
We have chosen the "National SBA" dataset, specifically "SBAnational.csv," obtained from the U.S. Small Business Administration. You can find the dataset at Link to SBAnational.csv.

2. Business Value and Questions:
The project aims to provide significant business value by addressing the following key questions:

1.	What are the key factors influencing loan approval or denial for small businesses?
2.	Can we predict whether a new loan application will result in a "CHGOFF" (charged off) status?
3.	How can lenders make informed decisions regarding loan approvals for new applications based on the risk of default?
The project seeks to improve the loan approval process for small businesses, reduce default risks, and enable lenders to make more informed lending decisions.

3. Prediction Target:
The primary prediction target is to determine whether a new loan application will result in a "CHGOFF" (charged off) status or not. Our Target Variable column is” MIS_Status” from the dataset.

4. Dataset Description:
The "SBAnational.csv" dataset, procured from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), encapsulates historical records ranging from 1962 to 2014. It encompasses 27 columns and an extensive total of 899,164 observations. 
To manage the dataset's size effectively, our project will focus on the subset of data spanning from 2008 to 2014, which comprises 96,845 rows.

Each row in the dataset represents a unique loan application. The dataset includes essential information about the borrowers and loans, including the borrower's name, location, industry classification, loan approval date, loan term, number of employees, business type (new or existing), jobs created/retained, franchise status, urban/rural classification, revolving line of credit, LowDoc Loan Program status, dates of default, disbursement, and various financial amounts.
